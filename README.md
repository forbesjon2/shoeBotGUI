# shoeBotGUI - rychange example
java swing GUI thats not functional atm because I dont have the API endpoints for certain webstores




## Create Accounts page
Attempting to use sonya75's NikeAccountGenerator with the proxies registered on this application. Or I may en up doing this in the application itself.

## Proxy management page
Manage proxies

## Create new / load existing credit cards page
This uses privacy.com to essentially create proxy credit cards

## Run configurations
The text is really messed up. I remember running into this problem once before I just havent gotten around to fixing it yet. Will fix when I get the SNKRS API endpoints.
